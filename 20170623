Location data analysis

The data of location：time is main judgement.
If the time is not the same ，the record will be invalid， and no need to think about others。
The second thing. If the event is exactly caught  the same place type and the same transition type should be judges.
When there are diffetent kinds of places， the most important thing is to find which is the nearest. This is the 
transaction to think about.

So，as the transition type has not been determined， we have to think about ignore the transition type provided by google.
So， in any kings of conditions， we have to consider these three dimensions.Time， space and time+space（treated as a transition）
When all these pre-conditions are satified， we could assert that they are the same event in reality world.
 
The third thing we need to know is that， this basic thing is right in every kind of condition this is right.

The other thing is to have a good conprehension？
